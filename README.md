# esphome-ifan03
ifan03 external component for esphome

This component can be used for iFan03 esphome configurations because custom components are being deprecated soon:

https://esphome.io/custom/custom_component.html

The code was modified from the following sources:

https://github.com/cpyarger/custom_components/tree/master/components/ifan

https://github.com/sliwma/mysmarthome/blob/main/ESPHome%20configs/Sonoff-iFAN03/Sonoff_iFAN03_buzzer.yaml

I had been using the latter but starting with ESPHome 2025.1.0 custom components are being deprecated.

Placing the code here in case anyone else needs it.
